## Hardware
- [x] camera - ZED
- [x] LIDAR - Velodyne VLP-16
- [x] Nvidia Jetson setup
- [x] capture with rosbag
- [x] install and run on the car
- [x] capture demo content 
- [x] capture real content
- [X] ~~Nvidia Drive PX2 setup~~ 
- [X] after meeting with Nvidia decided to use Jetson AGX Xavier
- [ ] improve capture
  - [ ] debug ZED low fps
  - [ ] find good IMU, see [here](https://www.jetsonhacks.com/2016/07/01/jetson-racecar-part-9-razor-imu-ros-install/)
- [ ] camera with integrated IMU and ROS support, consider:
  - [survey of ROS supported cameras](https://rosindustrial.org/3d-camera-survey/)
  - [optor](https://github.com/optor-vis/optor_vi-stereo-v1/blob/master/optor_VI_Sensor_SDK_V1.0/Optor%20User%20Manual.pdf), 149$ - cheap, bad - no sync 
  - [Tara](https://www.e-consystems.com/3D-USB-stereo-camera.asp), 149$ - cheap
  - [ZED mini](https://www.stereolabs.com/zed-mini/), 449$ - with color
  - [DUO mlx](https://duo3d.com/product/duo-minilx-lv1#tab=overview), 695$ - very wide FOV, accurate
- camera should preferably:
  - be ROS integrated
  - have built-in IMU
  - be industrial: high dynamic range, global shutter, precise calibration
  - RGB is better than monochromatic although it depends on detector perforamce with grayscale images
  - have wide FOV
  - be stereo
  - have good SDK
  - see discussion

  - from here we see than [mynt](https://mynteyeai.com/products/mynt-eye-stereo-camera) can be good
    
- [ ] automate capture - launch files
- [ ] capture new content
- [ ] Nvidia Jetson Xavier setup
- [ ] install and run on the car
- [ ] TODO: update regarding the electric car
  - [ ] sensors
  - [ ] control
