# Cone Dataset
Dataset is uploaded to [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CwCLIn6-bIfx65o2MbEX1sjESgL1O8oQ)  
Currently we have 125 images (78 labeled) and will need to collect at least 1000 in total (in addition to synthetic data)  

## Image Annotation 
We'll use [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) to tag the images (binary included)
